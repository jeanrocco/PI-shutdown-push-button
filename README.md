# PI-shutdown-push-button
A header mounted push button that will safely shutdown the Raspberry PI

This project describes a very simple but very very usefull tool that allow you to safely shutdown your Raspberry PI. This is specially usefull with a headless PI that you cannot connect to because your network/wifi is down... you probably know what I mean... the question is then how to safely shutdown the PI without risking a SD card corruption. 

Now I didn't devised this setup, I got it from [GIMX](https://gimx.fr/wiki/index.php?title=RPi#Autostart_GIMX_at_boot_without_GUI). I thought this was so usefull thet I wanted to replicate it here so I would not loose it. 

My meager contribution is repackaging the push button and the led to easily mount them on the PI header.
